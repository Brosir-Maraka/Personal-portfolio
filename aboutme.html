  <p>My name is Brosir Maraka. 
    
    I am a graduate of Kenyatta University, class of 2013. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Education arts/ Enlish and Literature. For a long time, however, I have been discontented with this background as I felt this is not in line with my dream and long-term interests. For this reason, I recently, embarked on a challenging but exciting journey of becoming a software developer. This has been my long time dream and though I as alittle nervous at the beginning, I fill quite excited about it. Currently, I am working with a community of enthusiats who are commited to learning how to create new experiences in the tech industry for the next generation. This is actually my first website, but with the help of the technical staff at Moringa School, I believe I will be able to develop more complex and engaging sites that will offer my clients the best experience.</p>
