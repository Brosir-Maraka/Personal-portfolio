  <p>My name is Brosir Maraka. 
    
    I am a graduate of Kenyatta University, class of 2013. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Education arts/ Enlish and Literature. For a long time, however, I have been discontented with this background as I felt this is not in line with my dream and long-term interests. For this reason, I recently, embarked on a challenging but exciting journey of becoming a software developer. This has been my long time dream and though I as alittle nervous at the beginning, I fill quite excited about it. Currently, I am working with a community of enthusiats who are commited to learning how to create new experiences in the tech industry for the next generation. This is actually my first website, but with the help of the technical staff at Moringa School, I believe I will be able to develop more complex and engaging sites that will offer my clients the best experience.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>

        <p>My main hobbies include reading spiritual, political and histrical books. I also do article writing for both academic and fictional disciiplines. I also play football with my local soccer team and love exercising a lot. My normal day schedule would include gym from 6am to 8am, work from 8a to 4pm and playing soccer from five to 6pm. I am also quite interested in social development and social growth. I partner with friends and other like minded people from time to time to mobilise resources to support the vulnerable and less fortunate people within the society. For instance this year, the Utawala Blackstar FC fraternity and I moblised resources to help one of us who had lacked school fees to join form 1. Currently, my main interest is to become professional software developer. I plan to dedicate a considerable amount of time now and in the near future to achieving this goal.</p>
